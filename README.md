Documentation for World Wide Web, the first certified open source hardware perfume, available at https://www.catlab.tech/open-source-perfume.

Pitch

World Wide Web is the first certified open source hardware perfume <https://www.oshwa.org>. This genderless, wearable fragrance is a low-sillage scent, meaning that you can smell it on your skin without it overwhelming the space or people around you.


Preparation

For safety and supplies, Art and Olfaction’s fantastic open source perfume primer, https://artandolfaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IAO_1_PRIMER_V4.pdf, is an absolute must. 

Pure materials, such as those that comprise World Wide Web, can be diluted in solvents for efficiency, economics, and ease: it’s cheap and simple to work with resulting dilutions. The CAT Lab’s preferred solvent is DPG, also known as perfumer’s alcohol. Purchase Art and Olfaction’s recommended supplies, along with DPG and the materials identified below, before getting started.


Process

Reviewing Primer. Take another look at Art and Olfaction’s perfume primer, particularly the parts about safety.

Diluting Materials.  Using clean pipettes, dilute each of your materials to a ratio of 10% material to 90% DPG. (Ten drops of material to ninety drops of DPG usually does the trick.) Confirm the composition of each material before diluting, as some are already diluted.

Combining Materials. Line up the 10% dilutions you need for World Wide Web. Using each vial’s dropper or a clean pipette,  combine the dilutions to create an accord. (The recipe can be scaled up to create bigger batches.) Play with the proportions of World Wide Web to discover what suits your preferences and body chemistry. 

Learning More. If you’re even more curious about the perfumemaking process, consider taking an Atlas Obscura class with Saskia Wilson-Brown herself <https://www.atlasobscura.com/experiences/perfume-online-course>. (That’s how I got started!)


Perfume

There are two formulations of World Wide Web: funky and floral

Funky World Wide Web smells like walking through a carpeted data center in the 1990s with open windows overlooking the Pacific Ocean—in a good way. The initial hit of gasoline from hexanol-3-cis is a reminder that fossil fuels power data centers that support the web. The mysterious carpet comes from Norlimbanol. (Floral World Wide Web swaps Norlimbanol for neroli and orange blossom, symbolic of the disappearing orange groves that used to pepper Silicon Valley.) The faint scent of wood paneling comes from cedar, also inspired by the wood used to make telephone poles. The lingering Pacific comes from marine and ozone, evocative of the thousands of miles of destructive submarine cables that carry communications globally. 

Recreate or remix World Wide Web to imagine the Internet as you’d like it to be.
