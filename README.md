Documentation for World Wide Web, an open source perfume

Pitch

World Wide Web is one of the first open source* fragrances. This genderless, wearable fragrance is an intentionally low-sillage scent, meaning that you can smell it on your skin without it overwhelming the space (or people) around you.

*The recipe is public and freely replicable, but one accord is a registered trademark and some other accords may be protected by trade secrets.
 
Perfume

World Wide Web is inspired by Internet infrastructure. It opens with a hit of gasoline (hexanol-3-cis, 2 drops at 10% dilution in DPG), influenced by the fossil fuels that power data centers. That scent is joined by a splash of salty ocean (marine + ozone accord, 2 drops at 10% dilution in DPG), evocative of the thousands of miles of submarine cables that carry communications around the globe. It fades down into cedar, which is used to make telephone poles. The next part is up to you! If you’re feeling floral, the scent kicks up a wave of orange blossoms (neroli + orange blossom, 3 drops at 10% dilution in DPG) as a nod to Silicon Valley’s former life as an orchard. And if you’re feeling funky, the scent settles into a warm, animalistic note reminiscent of computer rooms (remember those?) (Norlimbanol, 3 drops at 10% dilution in DPG). Either scent is complex without being challenging - World Wide Web is a beginner’s perfume.
