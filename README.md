Documentation for World Wide Web, an open source perfume

Preamble

The vast majority of perfumes are purposefully proprietary, and they rely on intellectual property (IP) protections.  Molecules, methods, and packaging are protected by patents. Recipes for mixtures of raw materials, called accords, are shielded by trade secrets. Names and logos are registered as trademarks. And descriptions of notes are covered by copyrights.  The resulting IP thicket means that many fragrances cannot be  recreated, reinterpreted or reappropriated by competitors, let alone average people. But perfumemaking should be more accessible - fragrance is fun!

Openness offers an alternative, but it hasn’t caught on yet. As Open Source Smell Culture co-founder Saskia Brown-Wilson put it, “Open source programming around scent is also tricky because it’s a very new concept for the perfume industry . . . I think that sampling [in fragrance] is important and necessary because it allows people to build on each other’s creativity. It allows us to learn from each other.” The CAT Lab concurs, and we’re here to teach you fragrance fundamentals so you can create our recipe and craft your own.

Pitch

World Wide Web is one of the first open* source fragrances.  Each note in the fragrance connects to concrete, physical aspects of Internet infrastructure. This genderless, wearable fragrance is an intentionally low-sillage scent, meaning that you can smell it on your skin without it overwhelming the space (or people) around you.

*The recipe is public and freely replicable, but one accord is a registered trademark and some other accords may be protected by trade secrets.

Preparation

You need a few supplies to get started.

Workspace. Create a clean, sparse workspace with some paper towels on hand in case of a spill. Do not touch your eyes while working with perfume, and check the material safety data sheets for details, including allergens or irritants, before purchasing supplies.

Plastic Cups, Pipettes, Little Labels + Scent Strips. Buy some of those teeny plastic cups with lids, a bag of plastic pipettes, a box of little labels, and some scent strips for mixing, labeling, and sampling your test fragrances. Dilute accords in glass vials for long-term keeping. (We’re partial to labeled 4 ml glass vials with dropper caps.) Experiment with recipes using the cups until you find a combination you like, then mix bigger batches in labeled glass vials.

Accords. All accords—combinations of raw materials used to create scent impressions—are available from the Perfumer’s Apprentice, an independent and informative online source of fragrance supplies. Links are included in each recipe.

Perfumer’s Alcohol. After purchasing your accords, dilute each accord to 10% accord to 90% DPG, also known as perfumer’s alcohol. (You should be fine starting with 10 drops of accord to 90 drops of DPG, but confirm the composition of each accord - some come diluted already.)

Perfumemaking Class (optional). If you’re even more curious about the perfumemaking process, consider taking this Atlas Obscura class with Saskia Wilson-Brown herself. (That’s how we got started!)
Process

Line up the 10% accords you need for World Wide Web. Using each vial’s dropper or a clean pipette,  combine the accords according to the recipe. The number of drops to add to the fragrance are noted beside each accord. The recipe can be scaled up to create bigger batches. After testing World Wide Web, play with its proportions to find what suits your preferences and body chemistry. 
Perfume: World Wide Web

World Wide Web is inspired by Internet infrastructure. It opens with a hit of gasoline, influenced by the fossil fuels that power data centers. That scent is joined by a splash of salty ocean, evocative of the thousands of miles of submarine cables that carry communications around the globe. It fades down into cedar, which is used to make telephone poles. The next part is up to you! If you’re feeling floral, the scent kicks up a wave of orange blossoms as a nod to Silicon Valley’s former life as an orchard. And if you’re feeling funky, the scent settles into an animalistic, amber note reminiscent of computer rooms (remember those?). Either scent is complex without being challenging - World Wide Web is a beginner’s perfume.
